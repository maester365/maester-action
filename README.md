# Maester üî• Github Action

![Maester Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Action-Maester-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)

Monitor your Microsoft 365 tenant's security configuration using **Maester**, the PowerShell-based test automation framework.

Check out the [Maester documentation](https://maester.dev/) for more information on how to use Maester, or the [github action documentation](https://maester.dev/docs/monitoring/github) for more details on how to use the action.

> [!NOTE]
> This github action only supports [workload identity federation](https://maester.dev/docs/monitoring/github#set-up-the-github-actions-workflow) for authentication, since that is the recommended way to authenticate to Microsoft 365 services from Github Actions.

## üöÄ Features

- Run public and private tests for Microsoft 365 security configurations.
- Supports **Exchange Online** and **Teams** tests.
- Customizable test runs with include/exclude tags.
- Detailed test results with optional email and Teams notifications.
- Uploads test results as GitHub Action artifacts.
- Supports telemetry control for privacy-conscious workflows.
