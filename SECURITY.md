# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support all these versions of the Maester action. It is however advised to always use a pinned version of the action in your workflows. This is to ensure that you are not affected by breaking changes in the main branch. Full versions (eg. `v1.0.2`) of the action are tagged and **not changed** after they are released. We are also pushing a major tag (eg. `v1`) automatically. The main branch is used for development and may contain breaking changes.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `main`  | :white_check_mark: |
| `v1.0.x`   | :white_check_mark: |
| `v1.x.x`   | :white_check_mark: |
